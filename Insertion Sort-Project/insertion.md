# Insertion Project - Project 1## [22,27,16,2,18,6] --> Insertion Sort ### 1.Question-) Write the stages of the sequence given above according to the sort type.```[22,27,16,2,18,6] --> [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> [16,22,27,2,18,6] -> [2,16,22,27,18,6] -> [2,16,18,22,27,6] -> [2,6,16,18,22,27]```### 2.Question-) Write the Big-O notation.```The Big-O notation of Insertion Sort is O(n^2).```### 3.Question-) Time Complexity: After sorting the sequence, the number 18 falls under which of the following cases? Write it down.```Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle. --> (O(n^2))Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end. --> (O(n^2))Best case: The number we are looking for is at the top of the array. --> (O(n))The Sorted sequence is as follows : [2,6,16,18,22,27]fThe number 18 is included in the Average Case.```### 4.Question-) Write the first 4 steps of the sequence [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] according to Selection Sort.```[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] --> [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6] -> [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6] -> [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6] -> [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]```
